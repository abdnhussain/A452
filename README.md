GCSE HTML, CSS and JS project

Task 1 was a simple web page with a couple of buttons that replaced a piece of text using .innerHTML.

Task 2 allowed the user to add items to a predefined array/list of items.  I used a JavaScript function to add items to the original array.  I also used the .sort function and .length function in JS to give the user an option to sort the array in alphabetical order and to inform the user how many items were in the array.

Task 3 involved a button which would change the colour of the traffic lights.  I had to use an array with the images in them and then use a JS script to change the image using an if statement to reset the algorithm.

Task 4 was an extension of 3 by virtue of the fact that it automated the traffic light colour changing.  The button would start the script which would go through the colour sequence at a time interval using setInterval on the light changing function from task 3.
